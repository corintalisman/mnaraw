# MNA Raw
## Or How I Resolved An Inconsistency
This mod is an add-on to [Mana And Artifice](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mana-and-artifice). By default, MNA drops the ore block which causes two main problems:  
1. The Excavated Variants mod adds a lot more variants of Vinteum Ore if setup properly. Each ore block is different and clogs up one's inventory _very_ quickly.  
2. As of 1.18, the default behavior for ores is to drop a raw version of the item, not the ore block.  

This mod fixes that.

A. Probably, but this is my first mod and I'd have to figure out how to do that.
